    <h1>Mailroom Kiosk</h1>

        the interface that students interact with
    </p>

        <h1>Part I: Preparation</h1>
            <p>Below is a sketch of Brown's mail room kiosk and the multiple screens that users will view during interaction.</p> 
        <img class="kiosk_drawing" src="interface.pdf">
        <p> This interface solves the problem of digitizing the brown mailroom package pickup process. With this interface, students can choose 
            to view the amount of packages they have and pick up their mailroom packages. 
            The interface creates an orderly way for students with an ID to notify mailroom employees that they are present and desire package pickup. Users have to:
            <ul>
            <li>Approach the kiosk</li>
            <li>Swipe their card</li>
            <li>Select to pickup packages or cancel</li> 
            <li>Walk to pickup window</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

            </ol>
            <h3><b> Summarized Responses</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All users feel fairly comfortable interacting with this kiosk as they've used it very frequently. Most come with knowledge that a package has arrived while some use the kiosk to check.</li>
                <li>Users learned to use this kiosk their first year at Brown and recall reading signage and watching others.  </li>
                <li>The three observed users feel as though the information on the interface is thorough and allows them to confidently take next steps in the process. One indicated that she would like to know more about the size of packages</li>
                <li>All users have experienced errors when swiping their card. Two mention that swiping multiple times often helps the machine recognize their ID while another student prefers to use a new kiosk.</li>
                <li>Users have all never pressed the x on the first screen and didn't notice there were words written at the bottom of the interface.  All of them have never canceled their packages but assume it would take them to the home screen</li>
            </ul>
